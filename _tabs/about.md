# About This Site

For now, the main usage of this site is for me to post solutions for Leetcode
problems. Although it did not came to me that I am posting mainly Leetcode
stuffs.

After getting a job recently (finally), I'm a bit lost on what am I going to do
with this.

Junior Software Engineer, adventurer in Eorzea and a みこぴー. Although I didn't
liked web and the AI trend that is going on, but I guess I'm stuck with it.

# Other Notes

- The profile picture was taken at Feb, 2020 at Ueno Station. And the train was
  E4 Series Shinkansen. All of the E4 trains retired at 2021 (sad noise).
- The title "Atelier Chikuma" comes from the atelier game series. I especially
  recommend "Atelier Sophie".
