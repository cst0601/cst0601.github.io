# Shao-Tse "Chikuma" Chien

I'm a student pursuing master's degree in Compute Science at University of
California, Riverside. I'm expected to graduate in December, 2022 and currently
seeking a full time software engineer position in the United States.

I have experiences in the following fields: Parallel computing, Natural Language
Processing, Database and Backend.

* I will: Work hard
* I can: Learn new stuffs (quickly), do stuffs fast

I promise. So please consider give me an OA or interview. Thank you.

## WORK EXPERIENCES

### Galaxy Software Service Corporation
**Software Engineer Intern**, Taipei, 2020/03 - 2020/07
- Designed and developed a text preprocessing package that combines different processing methods under a unified
interface using Python for natural language processing (NLP), replacing old methods in 2 different projects to simplify
the workflows of text preprocessing.
- Developed functions of a WebAPI for training text classification models and making predictions based on BERT
models using Python and pyTorch to achieve similar accuracy with 5% smaller training data.
- Composed automation scripts for continuous integration pipelines and designed test cases using pyTest for 2 existing
natural language understanding projects.

## PROJECTS

Here are a list of projects that I have done in the past (or currently working
on / maintaining).

### Tensor Core Acclerated Monte Carlo Methods
- Designed a Monte Carlo algorithm that used matrix multiplication to perform probability experiments.
- Implemented the algorithm using **C++** with Nvidia **Tensor Cores** and **cuBLAS** that achieved 35.8% performance
improvement in execution time with 5000 probability experiments and had only and an error of $5\times 10^{-3}$ compared
running using CUDA cores.

### Holo Bot
- Developed a discord bot that checks schedules, Youtube, Twitter contents of streamers and supports more than 3,000
members using **Java**.
- Designed a modular system architecture and built a WebAPI that scrapes web contents for stream schedules using
**Python** and **Flask** to improve system stability and achieve 0 crashes since 12/19/2020.
- This project is still maintained by me, you can found it on my github page:
    * [Holo Bot](https://github.com/cst0601/Holo-Bot)
    * [Holo Schedule API](https://github.com/cst0601/holo_schedule_api)

### [Image Wizard](https://github.com/cst0601/Image-Wizard)
- Developed a GUI tool that implements Mask R-CNN to separate instances and backgrounds of images as well as
applying filters and rendering effects to images using TensorFlow, OpenCV and PyGtk in Python.
- Developed an effect that simulates bokeh photos without relying on DSLR or high-end smartphones using OpenCV
and Python.

### [Bearing Fault Diagnosis](https://github.com/cst0601/BearingFaultDiagnosis)
- Developed a program to detect and classify different types of bearing faults or the combined scenario using only
vibration data with different machine learning models including SOM, Neural Net in Python and Keras.

### Embedded Face Recognition
- Implemented a real-time human detection and facial recognition program in C++/OpenCV and Qt on Nvidia Jetson
TX2 embedded platform.

# Things I do when I am not programming
- I'm deep inside a rabbit hole called Hololive, so I watch streams, lives, and
other events. And my 推しはさくらみこです。
- Learn languages. Aside from English, I am learning Japanese (for various
reasons, probably related to the first bullet point). 
- Travel. Although I haven't been able to do so for some time.
- Gaming, especially paradox games (games which you make the world map into one
color) and FFXIV. Find me @ Elemental-Carbuncle. Maybe we could go on a raid
sometimes. (Currently busy doing other things and stopped at P7S, the tree
thing boss)
- Read visual novels, if you are interested in this, check out 月に寄り添う乙女の作法 series.
