## PROJECTS

Here is a list of projects that I have done in the past (or currently working
on / maintaining) that are probably interesting.

### Tensor Core Accelerated Monte Carlo Methods
- Designed a Monte Carlo algorithm that used matrix multiplication to perform
  probability experiments.
- Implemented the algorithm using **C++** with Nvidia **Tensor Cores** and
  **cuBLAS** that achieved 35.8% performance improvement in execution time with
  5000 probability experiments and had only and an error of $5\times 10^{-3}$
  compared running using CUDA cores.

### Holo Bot
- Developed a discord bot that checks schedules, Youtube, Twitter contents of
  streamers and supports more than 3,000 members using **Java**.
- Designed a modular system architecture and built a WebAPI that scrapes web
  contents for stream schedules using **Python** and **Flask** to improve system
  stability and achieve 0 crashes since 12/19/2020.
- This project is still maintained by me, you can found it on my Github page:
    * [Holo Bot](https://github.com/cst0601/Holo-Bot)
    * [Holo Schedule API](https://github.com/cst0601/holo_schedule_api)

# Things I do when I am not programming
- I'm deep inside a rabbit hole called Hololive, so I watch streams, lives, and
  other events. And my 推しはさくらみこです。
- Learn languages. Aside from English, I am learning Japanese (for various
  reasons, probably related to the first bullet point).
- Travel. Although I haven't been able to do so for some time.
- Gaming, especially paradox games (games which you make the world map into one
  color) and FFXIV. Find me @ Elemental-Carbuncle. I got a house at Shirogane
  29-51. Maybe we could go on a raid sometimes.
- Read visual novels, if you are interested in this, check out Yuzusoft's games
  and 月に寄り添う乙女の作法 series.

# Other Notes

- The profile picture was taken at Feb, 2020 at Ueno Station. And the train was
  E4 Series Shinkansen. All of the E4 trains retired at 2021 (sad noise).
- The title "Atelier Chikuma" comes from the atelier game series. I especially
  recommend "Atelier Sophie".
