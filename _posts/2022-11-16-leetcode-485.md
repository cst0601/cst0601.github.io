## Problem

Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo
attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly `duration` seconds. More
formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive
time interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`. If Teemo attacks again before the poison
effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration
seconds after the new attack.

You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where `timeSeries[i]`
denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer
duration.

Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

## Approach

Today's randomly picked question. I have to say, the problem description is
the worst of what I have encountred, for obvious reasons. And yes, I don't like
LOL.

My first thought is to use a set to store all of the `timeSeries` and setup
an integer to keep track of the debuff time. Therefore, when iterating
through the time from (0 or from `timeSeries[0]`), we could check if there is
another poison casted at the time and reset the debuff time. This algorithm
some how passes all the test without TLE (I thought it will). The following is
the implementation of the solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPoisonedDuration(vector<int>& timeSeries, int duration) {
        int debuffTotal = 0;
        int curDuration = 0;
        std::unordered_set<int> timeSet(timeSeries.begin(), timeSeries.end());

        for (int time = 0; time <= timeSeries.back()+duration; time++) {
            if (timeSet.count(time)) {
                curDuration = duration;
            }

            if (curDuration-- > 0) debuffTotal++;
        }

        return debuffTotal;
    }
};
```

However there is a much more simpler solution. Simply iterate through
`timeSeries`, if the next element in the series compared to the current element
is less then `duration`, then the whole segment (
`timeSeries[i+1] - timeSeries[i]`) will be under poison's effect.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPoisonedDuration(std::vector<int>& timeSeries, int duration) {
        int debuffTotal = 0;

        if (timeSeries.size() == 0) return 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < timeSeries.size() - 1; i++) {
            debuffTotal += std::min(timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i], duration);
        }

        return debuffTotal + duration;
    }

};
```
