## Problem

Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer
`target`, return a list of all ***unique combinations*** *of `candidates` where
the chosen numbers sum to `target`*. You may return the combinations in **any
order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of
times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the
chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that
sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

Note: all elements of `candidates` are **distinct**.

## Solution

Basically, the algorithm tries out all different combinations to see if the
combination matches the sum `target`. We try add numbers, and if in the end we
could not match `target`, pop numbers and try a different number from
`candidates`. This is essentially backtrack.

1. Adding a number from `candidates`, the target becomes `target -
   selected_candidate`.
2. Add another number and repeat the process.
3. If target becomes 0, push the set of selected number to output. If target < 0
   return as this combination failed.
4. Pop a number from the selected set, try another number.

Since every elements of `candidates` are distinct, to prevent duplicated
combination, we simply choose *next* number from `candidates` when backtracking
(popping numbers from selected set).

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void runner(vector<int>& candidates, int target,
             vector<int>& temp, int start, vector<vector<int>>& output) {
        if (target == 0) {
            output.push_back(temp);
            return;
        }
        else if (target < 0) return;

        for (int i = start; i < candidates.size(); i++) {
            temp.push_back(candidates[i]);
            runner(candidates, target - candidates[i], temp, i, output);
            temp.pop_back();
        }
    }

    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> output;
        vector<int> temp;

        runner(candidates, target, temp, 0, output);

        return output;
    }
};
```
