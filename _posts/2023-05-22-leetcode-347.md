## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent
elements. You may return the answer in **any order**.

## Solution

I have two slightly different solutions to the problem. But the preparation
works are the same: First count the numbers with a map, then

* **Array (sort)**: Dump all the contents into an array, then sort it by
  frequency.
* **Min Heap**: Put the pairs in a heap. The heap could either be a max heap,
which you get `k` numbers from top. Or you use a min heap, but you pop the top
element if the heap size is larger than `k`. The method using min heap is more
efficient since the time complexity of pushing / popping elements could be
lower. Moreover, memory consumption is also better as there are at most, `k+1`
elements stored in the heap.

## Implementation

#### A. Sorting array
```cpp
vector<int> topKFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    unordered_map<int, int> bin;
    for (int n: nums) bin[n]++;

    vector<pair<int, int>> dump(bin.begin(), bin.end());
    sort(dump.begin(), dump.end(), [](auto lhs, auto rhs)->bool {
        return lhs.second > rhs.second;
    });

    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) result.push_back(dump[i].first);

    return result;
}
```

#### B. Heap (min-heap)
Min heap in C++ could be done using `priority_queue`.

> ##### Constructing `priority_queue`
> I found a solution that constructs the `priority_queue` with a lambda function
> comparator in a pleasant way. What I usually do is: (`binIt` is the iterator
> of the hash map)
> ```cpp
> // binIt is the iterator of the unordered_map that stores the number and its frequency
> auto comp = [](binIt lhs, binIt rhs) -> bool { return lhs->second > rhs->second; };
> priority_queue(binIt, vector<binIt>, decltype(comp)) heap(comp, vector<binIt>());
> ```
> Since I thought I couldn't get the type of a lambda function, I will need
> `decltype` to slap it in `priority_queue`'s template. However, there is a
> wrapper called
> [`std::function`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function)
> that does the job. Therefore, declaration of the `priority_queue` becomes:
> ```cpp
> priority_queue<binIt, vector<binIt>, function<bool(binIt, binIt)>> heap
>     ([](binIt lhs, binIt rhs) -> bool { return lhs->second > rhs->second; },
>         vector<binIt>());
> ```
> Now the whole comparator could be fitted into the parameter of `priority_queue`.

The full implementation using min heap is as the following:
```cpp
vector<int> topKFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    using binIt = unordered_map<int, int>::iterator;

    unordered_map<int, int> bin;
    for (int n: nums) bin[n]++;

    // min-heap
    priority_queue<binIt, vector<binIt>, function<bool(binIt, binIt)>> heap
        ([](binIt lhs, binIt rhs) -> bool { return lhs->second > rhs->second; },
            vector<binIt>());

    for (binIt it = bin.begin(); it != bin.end(); it++) {
        heap.push(it);
        if (heap.size() > k) heap.pop();
    }

    vector<int> result;
    while (!heap.empty()) {
        result.push_back(heap.top()->first);
        heap.pop();
    }

    return result;
}
```
