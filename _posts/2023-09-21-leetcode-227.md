## Description

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and
return its value.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate
results will be in the range of $[-2^{31}, 2^{31} - 1]$.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings
as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

## Solution

Consider in solving a mathematical expression, we need to process multiplication
and division before addition and subtraction. Therefore, we could use a stack
and first process all the multiplications and divisions and push the results
back into the stack. Then we calculate addition and subtraction to get the
result.

However, I found an ingenuous way of doing this with a `stringstream`. Couldn't
find the original author of this piece of code as I dig this up from an
submission I did a few years ago.

1. We process the whole expression from the start and record the last value we
   processed. If we encounter an **multiplication or division** operator, we
   would revert the addition / subtraction done in the last operation.
1. Do the multiplication and division, then add back the last added / subtracted
   number.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int calculate(std::string s) {
        char op;
        std::stringstream ss("+" + s);		// init stringstream with arithmithic expression
                                            // starts with a + operator to initialize result
                                            // to the first number in the expression
        int result = 0, last, rhs;

        while (ss >> op >> rhs) {
            if (op == '+' || op == '-') {
                rhs = (op == '+')? rhs: -rhs;
                result += rhs;
            }
            else {
                rhs = (op == '*')? last * rhs: last / rhs;
                result = result - last + rhs;
            }
            last = rhs;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
