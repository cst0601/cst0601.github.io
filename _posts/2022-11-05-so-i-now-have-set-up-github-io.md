After some time getting to know Jekyll and tried out the (very nice looking)
Chirpy theme, now I finally have my github.io page setup properly. But I'm still
thinking about what should I post here. The page looks really empty now. 

I was originally thinking about posting about programming related articles,
however, as a student, I'm still in the process of learning new things. Even
though there are a few topics that I'm have a better grasp on, but thinking 
that there are many many others doing a better job than I could, made me
hesitated. I do not even have a job, that could give me professional experience.

Nonetheless, some day, if I'm confident enough, there will be some technical
posts.
