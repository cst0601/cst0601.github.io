## Problem

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n -
1` edges.

You are given a 2D integer array edges of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai,
bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.
You are also given an integer array restricted which represents restricted
nodes.

Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach from node `0` without visiting
a restricted node.

Note that node `0` will not be a restricted node.

## Solution

A DFS will do :).

First use a hash map to store the tree using the edges provided for later
traversal. Note that since the tree is undirected, we need to store both
direction of an edge. Moreover, we will need a hash map for restricted nodes and
another to keep track of visited nodes (since the tree is undirected, we don't
want to visit a node multiple times).

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reachableNodes(
            int n,
            vector<vector<int>>& edges,
            vector<int>& restricted)
    {
        unordered_set<int> restrict_set(restricted.begin(), restricted.end());
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> tree;
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        int output = 1;

        for (const auto &edge: edges) {
            tree[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            tree[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        stack<int> temp;
        temp.push(0);
        while (!temp.empty()) {
            int cur = temp.top();
            temp.pop();
            visited.insert(cur);

            for (auto child: tree[cur]) {
                if (restrict_set.find(child) == restrict_set.end() &&
                    visited.find(child) == visited.end()) {
                    temp.push(child);
                    output++;
                }
            }
        }

        return output;
    }
};
```
