## Description

You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the ranks of some mechanics.
`ranks`$_\text{i}$ is the rank of the `i`$^\text{th}$ mechanic. A mechanic with
a rank `r` can repair `n` cars in `r * n^2` minutes.

You are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars
waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return the ***minimum** time taken to repair all the cars*.

Note: All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

## Solution

Think this problem as two subproblems:
1. If a given time is sufficient for mechanics to fix all cars.
2. Binary search to find the lowest time required to fix the cars.

For 1., the cars that a mechanic with rank `r` in `time` could fix is
$\sqrt{\text{time}/r}$ cars. The maximum of cars that the mechanics could fix
could be obtained easily by summing up the numbers.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:

    bool isPossibleInTime(const vector<int>& ranks, int cars, long long time) {
        long long maxCars = 0;
        for (auto i: ranks) {
            maxCars += static_cast<int>(sqrt(time / i));
        }
        return maxCars >= cars;
    }

    long long repairCars(vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        long long minTime = 1;
        long long maxTime = (long long)cars * cars * ranks.front();
        long long mid = (maxTime + minTime) / 2;

        while (maxTime > minTime) {
            if (isPossibleInTime(ranks, cars, mid)) {
                maxTime = mid;
            }
            else {
                minTime = mid + 1;
            }
            mid = (maxTime + minTime) / 2;
        }

        return mid;
    }
};
```
