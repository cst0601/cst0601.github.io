## Description

Given a string `s`, return the number of homogenous substrings of `s`. Since the
answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

## Solution

Since we are counting the number of all homogenous substring, we do not need
additional data structure to hold the number of each homogenous substring.

Given a string "aaa" and by iterating though this string:
* str[0], we could find a homogenous substr "a".
* str[1], we could also find a homgenous substr "a" and "aa".
* str[2], "a" "aa" "aaa"

Therefore, we could find that when the last character is the same as the
current one, then we could find additional "number of repetitive characters"
number of homogenous substring.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countHomogenous(string s) {
        int output = 0, cur = 0;
        char last = 0;

        for (auto c: s) {
            if (c != last) {
                last = c;
                cur = 1;
            }
            else {
                cur++;
            }
            output += cur;
            output %= 1'000'000'007;
        }

        return output;
    }
};
```

```rs
impl Solution {
    pub fn count_homogenous(s: String) -> i32 {
        let (mut output, mut cur) = (0, 0);
        let mut last: char = '\0';

        for c in s.chars() {
            if c != last {
                last = c;
                cur = 1;
            } else {
                cur += 1;
            }
            output += cur;
            output %= 1_000_000_007;
        }

    output
    }
}
```
