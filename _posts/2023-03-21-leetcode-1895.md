## Problem

A `k x k` magic square is a `k x k` grid filled with integers such that every
row sum, every column sum, and both diagonal sums are all equal. The integers in
the magic square do not have to be distinct. Every `1 x 1` grid is trivially a
magic square.

Given an `m x n` integer `grid`, return the size (i.e., the side length `k`) of
the largest magic square that can be found within this grid.

## Approach

A magic square should have its sum of every row, column and diagonals be the
same. However, there will be many repetition in calculating the sums. For
example, with a `3 x 3` square, to check if this square is a magic square, we
first calculate all the sum of each rows, columns and diagonals. If this 3 by 3
square is not a magic square we move on checking if the `2 x 2` (starting from
the top right, `(0, 0)`) is a magic square. Here, we sort of calculated the sum
already when checking the `3 x 3` square and we could make our solution faster
by eliminating the repeated calculations.

## Solution

In this solution, we are using prefix sum. We first calculate the each row,
column and the diagonal's prefix sum, therefore, we could quicky get the sum
when dealing with all different sizes of square in $O(1)$.

The rest should be simple, starting from `(0, 0)`, we iterate through all the
numbers in the input matrix and try build a square from it. We should start from
the largest square with the starting location in the matrix and skip all the
squares that is smaller than the current largest magic square size to further
decrease the redundant calculations.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestMagicSquare(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid.front().size();
        int largestSize = 1;

        std::vector<std::vector<int>> row, col, diag, rdiag;
        row = col = diag = rdiag = grid;

        // build prefix sum
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (j != 0) row[i][j] += row[i][j-1];
                if (i != 0) col[i][j] += col[i-1][j];
                if (i != 0 && j != 0) diag[i][j] += diag[i-1][j-1];
                if (i != 0 && j != 0) rdiag[i][n-j-1] += rdiag[i-1][n-j];
            }
        }

        // check if magic square
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // starting from the largest square possible and skip all the
                // square that are smaller than the current largest magic squrare
                for (int size = std::min(m-i, n-j); size > largestSize; size--) {

                    bool magic = true;
                    // diagonal
                    int sum = diag[i+size-1][j+size-1] - ((i-1 < 0 || j-1 < 0)? 0: diag[i-1][j-1]);
                    magic = sum == rdiag[i+size-1][j] - ((i-1 < 0 || j+size >= n)? 0: rdiag[i-1][j+size]);

                    // check each row, column
                    for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) {
                        magic &= sum == row[i+k][j+size-1] - ((j-1 < 0)? 0: row[i+k][j-1]);
                        magic &= sum == col[i+size-1][j+k] - ((i-1 < 0)? 0: col[i-1][j+k]);
                    }
                    if (magic) largestSize = std::max(largestSize, size);
                }
            }
        }

        return largestSize;
    }
};
