Holo Bot is one of my projects that is still being maintained. It is a discord
bot that checkes web servies and help notify users with new contents. After
some years (2, to be more specific), many more functionality has been added.

It all started back in 2020 when my fellow 35P, Ben DMed me and asked if I
could develope a discord bot that could broadcast twitter posts faster. By the
time what we had is a discord bot using IFTTT service, which its update speed
was abysmal. And yes, we knew that we could pay to make it faster. However, it
would be nice if we could have better services without spending any dollar
right? And afterall, we are software engineers. So I build a discord bot, that
interacts with Twitter's API, hosted it on Oracle cloud's free tier VM and there
we have it, a faster bot with 0 cost. 

Now after two years, this simple bot had many new features. It now could check
Hololive members stream schedule, look at the members that are now currently
streaming, @ a lot of users :) when someone went live and now even could verify
user's channel subscription.
