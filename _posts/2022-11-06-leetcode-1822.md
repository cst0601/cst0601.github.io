# Problem 

There is a function `signFunc(x)` that returns:

* `1` if `x` is positive.
* `-1` if `x` is negative.
* `0` if `x` is equal to `0`.

You are given an integer array `nums`. Let product be the `product` of all values in the array `nums`.

Return `signFunc(product)`.

# Approach (Rant) and Solution

This is the problem that I got when pressed the "Pick One" button today. 
Probably a bit too easy for a Leetcode easy problem.

The main problem when doing it naively, multiply all numbers and return
1, -1 or 0 accordingly, will probably overflow. Therefore, we do a if to all
numbers and only save 0, 1 or -1.

# Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arraySign(vector<int>& nums) {
        int product = 1;

        for (auto n: nums) {
            if (n == 0) return 0;
            else if (n < 0) product *= -1;
        }

        return product;
    }
};
```
