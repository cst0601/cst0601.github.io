## Description

In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is even, the ith node (**0-indexed**) of
the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <=
(n / 2) - 1`.

* For example, if `n = 4`, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the
twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.

The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return the *maximum twin
sum* of the linked list.

## Solution

I guessed that this could work even if you brute forced it by keeping all the
content in the linked list into a vector. However, this problem probably wants
us to use fast slow pointer, even better if we could do this in one pass.

### Fast Slow Pointer, O(n/2) space

We first start off by using fast slow pointer to find the middle, at the same
time we store the first half of the linked list in a vector. Then we use this
vector to combine with the second half of the list to find the maximum sum.

Time and space complexity of this solution will be O(n) and O(n), respectively.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int pairSum(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> sum;
        ListNode *fast = head, *slow = head;
        int output = numeric_limits<int>::min();

        while (fast) {
            sum.push_back(slow->val);

            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        size_t n = sum.size() * 2;
        size_t i = sum.size();
        while (slow) {
            output = max(output, sum[n-1-i] + slow->val);
            i++;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        return output;
    }
};
```

### Fast Slow Pointer, O(1) space

Similar to the first solution, we still need to find the middle by using fast
slow pointer. However, this time we reverse the second half of the linked list
and iterate through the list from both ends to find the maximum sum.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pairSum(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode *fast = head->next, *slow = head;
        int output = 0;

        while (fast->next) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        ListNode *next = nullptr, *prev = nullptr;
        slow = slow->next;
        while (slow) {
            next = slow->next;
            slow->next = prev;
            prev = slow;
            slow = next;
        }

        while (prev) {
            output = max(output, head->val + prev->val);
            head = head->next;
            prev = prev->next;
        }

        return output;
    }
};
```

Well, in leetcode, whatever I did to the linked list, its not my responsibility
to deal with memory leak or anything related. Therefore, I guess that reversing
half of the list is fine.

### Brute Force, O(n) time O(n) space

Actually the performance is not too bad, the execution time is still comparable
to the second solution. My guess is that prefetching and caching helped when
dealing with vector.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pairSum(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> temp;
        int output = 0;

        while (head) {
            temp.push_back(head->val);
            head = head->next;
        }

        for (size_t i = 0; i < temp.size() / 2; i++) {
            output = max(output, temp[i] + temp[temp.size()-i-1]);
        }

        return output;
    }
};
```
