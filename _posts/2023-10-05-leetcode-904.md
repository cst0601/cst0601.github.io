## Description

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left
to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where
`fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some
strict rules that you must follow:

* You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of
  fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
* Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from
  every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked
  fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
* Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must
  stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return the maximum number of fruits you can
pick.

## Solution

For this problem, we are finding the max length of a subarray that has only two
different numbers in it.

This could be solved by using a sliding window and a hash map for recording the
numbers and its count in this subarray.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        int front = 0, back = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;

        for (; back < fruits.size(); back++) {
            count[fruits[back]]++;
            while (count.size() > 2) {
                if (--count[fruits[front]] == 0) count.erase(fruits[front]);
                front++;
            }
            maxCount = max(maxCount, back - front + 1);
        }

        return maxCount;
    }
};
```

A more cool way of doing this is to keep the maximum length of the sliding
window (therefore, front and back pointers). And keep processing numbers.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        int front = 0, back = 0;

        for (; back < fruits.size(); back++) {
            count[fruits[back]]++;
            if (count.size() > 2) {
                if (--count[fruits[front]] == 0) count.erase(fruits[front]);
                front++;
            }
        }

        return back - front;
    }
};
```
