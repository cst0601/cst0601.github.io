## Problem

Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, return
`true` *if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop
operations on an initially empty stack, or `false` otherwise.*

## Solution

We could simulate push and pop operation from the input and check if the
simulated stack matches the pop sequence. i.e. if the simulated stack is empty
by the end of the simulation.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
        stack<int> temp;
        int i = 0;

        for (auto n: pushed) {
            temp.push(n);
            while (!temp.empty() && temp.top() == popped[i]) {
                temp.pop();
                i++;
            }
        }

        return temp.empty();
    }
};
```
