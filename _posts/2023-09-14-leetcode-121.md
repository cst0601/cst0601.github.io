## Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock
on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock
and choosing a **different day** in the future to sell that stock.

Return the *maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot
achieve any profit, return 0.

## Solution

This should be a lot simpler if you know how to solve [123. Best Time to But and
Sell Stock III](/posts/leetcode-123). But starting from here is better.

Since this problem is about finding a optimized (max) profit, dynamic
programming should come into mind. So you maintain a minimum price as the best
time to buy the stock and the time to sell it by iterating through the prices.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0, minPrice = INT_MAX;

        for (auto i: prices) {
            minPrice = min(minPrice, i);
            profit = max(profit, i - minPrice)
        }

        return profit;
    }
};
```

Below is a unnecessary version of the DP solution, followed the general solution
mentioned in [leetcode 123](/posts/leetcode-123). Definitely not efficient, but
its a fun thing to think about solving this in a general (other stock
optimization programming problems) way.

The array `holdStock` optimized the best price to buy the stock (the lowest
price). And the array `noStock` optimizes the best time to sell the stock.

```cpp
class Solution {
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<int> noStock(n+1, 0);
        vector<int> holdStock(n+1, INT_MIN);

        for (int i = 1; i < n+1; i++) {
            holdStock[i] = max(holdStock[i-1], noStock[i] - prices[i-1]); // hold / buy stock
            noStock[i] = max(noStock[i-1], holdStock[i] + prices[i-1]);   // hold / sell stock
        }

        return noStock.back();
    }
};
```
