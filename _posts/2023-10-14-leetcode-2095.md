## Description

You are given the `head` of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the `head` of the modified linked list.

The **middle node** of a linked list of size `n` is the `⌊n / 2⌋th` node from
the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less
than or equal to `x`.

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

## Solution

We could solve this problem by iterating through the list twice, first iteration
getting the size of this linked list and the second iteration finding the middle
node.

However, we could do it in one pass by using fast slow pointer. i.e. we
initialize two nodes, one traverses the list by jumping two nodes at a time, and
a slow pointer traverses the list one at a time. This way when the fast pointer
reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will sit right in the middle of
the list.

## Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head) {
        if (head->next == nullptr) return nullptr;

        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head, *slowPrev = head;

        while (fast->next && fast->next->next) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slowPrev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        // list size is odd
        if (fast->next) {
            slowPrev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        slowPrev->next = slow->next;
        delete slow;

        return head;
    }
};
```

The above solution might be more intuitive, below is a more condensed version,
but the concept are the same.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head) {
        if (head->next == nullptr) return nullptr;

        ListNode *fast = head->next->next;
        ListNode *slow = head, *temp = nullptr;

        while (fast && fast->next) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }
        temp = slow->next;
        slow->next = slow->next->next;
        delete temp;

        return head;
    }
};
```
