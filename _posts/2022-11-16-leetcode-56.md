## Problem

Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all
overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals
that cover all the intervals in the input.

## Approach

If two interval intersects, then one of the intervals' start will be in between
of another interval's start and end. To make the problem simpler, we sort the
input intervals and iterate through it. If the current iterated interval does
not overlap with any previous intervals, then the interval's start will be
greater than the end of merged interval (and so does the next, and the next
after that). If there is an overlap, then merge.

Time complexity should be $O(n\log n)$.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> merge(
            std::vector<std::vector<int>>& intervals) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> output;
        std::sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());

        for (auto i: intervals) {
            if (output.empty() || i[0] > output.back()[1] )
                output.push_back(i);
            else {
                output.back()[1] = std::max(i[1], output.back()[1]);
            }
        }

        return output;
    }
};
```
