# Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock
on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most **two
transactions**.

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you
must sell the stock before you buy again).

# Solution

This post is to admire a great
[explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/solutions/108870/most-consistent-ways-of-dealing-with-the-series-of-stock-problems/)
on Leetcode. I recommend you skip what I wrote below and take a look at the
author's explanation.

It is quite obvious that this problem could be solved with Dynamic Programming.
But figuring out the solution is still hard.

The basic idea of this solution is to think about how many condition need to
take into consideration when deciding to buy / sell / hold the stock.

1. Stock price on `ith` day.
1. Number of stock transactions done already.
1. Currently holding / not holding a stock.

Since there are three conditions to think about, the DP table should be three
dimension. Or you could create 2 DP tables representing the current profit when
holding 0 / 1 stock.

Let `dpNoStock[i][j]` and `dpHoldStock[i][j]` be the maximum profit of `ith` day
and have done `j` transactions when not holding / holding a stock. Each day we
should maximize our profit by deciding if we should hold / buy / sell a stock.

`dpNoStock` should be initialized with 0 while `dpHoldStock` could be
initialized with `INT_MIN` as to make `dpNoStock` decide to buy stock (see the
recurrence relation below).

The recurrence relation of the DP table should be:
* `dpNoStock[i][j] = max(dpNoStock[i-1][j], dpHoldStock[i-1][j] + prices[i])`
* `dpHoldStock[i][j] = max(dpHoldStock[i-1][j], dpNoStock[i-1][j-1] - prices[i])`

As you may see from the recurrence relation, the DP table could also be further
optimized only a set of values are used in each iteration, making space
complexity $O(1)$. However, the original version is more general that it could
solve problems with `k` transaction limits.

Finally, the result should be the last element of `dpNoStock` (of course we
shouldn't be holding any stock at the end).

# Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int dpSize = prices.size() + 1;
        vector<vector<int>> dpNoStock (
            dpSize, vector<int>(2)
        );
        vector<vector<int>> dpHoldStock (
            dpSize, vector<int>(2, INT_MIN)
        );
        // ith day, j transactions done, hold/no stock at hand

        for (int i = 1; i < dpSize; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
                int profitNotHolding = (j-1 >= 0)? dpNoStock[i-1][j-1]: 0;
                dpNoStock[i][j] = max(dpNoStock[i-1][j], dpHoldStock[i-1][j] + prices[i-1]);     // hold / sell stock
                dpHoldStock[i][j] = max(dpHoldStock[i-1][j], profitNotHolding - prices[i-1]);    // hold / buy stock
            }
        }

        return dpNoStock.back().back();
    }
};
```

### Optimized

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int noStock1 = 0, noStock2 = 0;                     // 1, 2 denotes the number of transactions done
        int holdStock1 = INT_MIN, holdStock2 = INT_MIN;

        for (auto i: prices) {
            noStock2 = max(noStock2, holdStock2 + i);
            holdStock2 = max(holdStock2, noStock1 - i);
            noStock1 = max(noStock1, holdStock1 + i);
            holdStock1 = max(holdStock1, -i);
        }

        return noStock2;
    }
};
```
