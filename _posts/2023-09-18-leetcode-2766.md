## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` representing the initial
positions of some marbles. You are also given two **0-indexed** integer arrays
`moveFrom` and `moveTo` of equal length.

Throughout `moveFrom.length` steps, you will change the positions of the
marbles. On the `ith` step, you will move **all** marbles at position
`moveFrom[i]` to position `moveTo[i]`.

After completing all the steps, return the *sorted list of occupied positions*.

**Notes:**
* We call a position **occupied** if there is at least one marble in that
  position.
* There may be multiple marbles in a single position.

## Solution

This problem could be solved with a hash map, recording the number of the
locations of the marbles and the number of marbles at that location. Iterate
through `moveFrom` and `moveTo` array for the corresponding moves and we should
get the result by sorting the keys of the hash map.

Seeing the constraints on `nums` is `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, sorting the
keys shouldn't cause TLE.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> relocateMarbles(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& moveFrom, vector<int>& moveTo) {
        vector<int> output;
        unordered_map<int, int> m;  // location, # marbles
        for (int i: nums) m[i]++;

        for (int i = 0; i < moveFrom.size(); i++) {
           int num = m[moveFrom[i]];
           m.erase(moveFrom[i]);
           m[moveTo[i]] += num;
        }

        for (auto p: m) {
            output.push_back(p.first);
        }
        sort(output.begin(), output.end());

        return output;
    }
};
```
