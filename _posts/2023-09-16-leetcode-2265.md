# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the *number of nodes where the value
of the node is equal to the **average** of the values in its **subtree***.

Note:
* The **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by
  `n` and **rounded down** to the nearest integer.
* A **subtree** of `root` is a tree consisting of `root` and all of its
  descendants.

# Solution

No way this is a medium problem.

This problem could be easily solved with a DFS. The recursive function returns
the number of nodes in this subtree start with a node `root` and the sum of the
nodes in the subtree. If the node `root` has the value equivalent to the average
of the nodes in this subtree, add one to result.

# Implementation

In my implementation I returned three numbers in the recursive function, which
is the number of nodes that satisfies the requirement, the number of nodes and
the sum of the values of nodes. We could make the result (# of nodes satisfies
the requirement) as a member variable of the Solution class to reduce the data
required to return. (But I'm too lazy to spend any more time on this simple
problem)

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:

    vector<int> runner(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> info(3); // number of qualified nodes, number of nodes, sum of the values of nodes
        if (!root) return info;

        vector<int> left = runner(root->left);
        vector<int> right = runner(root->right);

        info[0] = left[0] + right[0];
        info[1] = left[1] + right[1] + 1;
        info[2] = left[2] + right[2] + root->val;

        int avg = info[2] / info[1];

        if (root->val == avg) info[0]++;

        return info;
    }

    int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result = runner(root);
        return result[0];
    }
};
```
