## Problem

Given a sentence `text` (A sentence is a string of space-separated words) in the
following format:

* First letter is in upper case.
* Each word in `text` are separated by a single space.

Your task is to rearrange the words in text such that all words are rearranged
in an increasing order of their lengths. If two words have the same length,
arrange them in their original order.

Return the new text following the format shown above.

## Solution

Nothing too interesting to explain, makes me wonder why is problem is
categorized as "medium".

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string arrangeWords(string text) {
        map<int, string> m;
        text[0] = tolower(text[0]);
        stringstream ss(text);
        string word, output;

        while (ss >> word) m[word.size()] += word + " ";
        for (const auto &pair: m) output += pair.second;
        output.pop_back();
        output[0] = toupper(output[0]);
        return output;
    }
};
```
