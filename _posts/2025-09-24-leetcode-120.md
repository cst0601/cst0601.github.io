## Description

Given a `triangle` array, return the *minimum path sum from top to bottom*.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More 
formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either 
index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

## Solution

This problem could be solved with dynamic programming and we could do it in 
place using the input `triangle`. For every layer of the triangle, we also 
maintain a minimum sum for that layer. After we are done with the last layer of 
the triangle, the minimum sum will be the answer.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(vector<vector<int>>& triangle) {
        int minTotal = triangle[0][0];

        for (size_t i = 1; i < triangle.size(); i++) {
            minTotal = INT_MAX;
            for (size_t j = 0; j < i+1; j++) {
                if (j == 0) { 
                    triangle[i][0] += triangle[i-1][0];
                } else if (j == i) {
                    triangle[i][j] += triangle[i-1][j-1];
                } else {
                    triangle[i][j] += min(triangle[i-1][j-1], triangle[i-1][j]);
                }
                minTotal = min(minTotal, triangle[i][j]);
            }
        }  

        return minTotal;
    }
};
```
