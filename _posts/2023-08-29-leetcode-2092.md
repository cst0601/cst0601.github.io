## Problem

You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` people numbered from `0`
to `n - 1`. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array meetings where
`meetings[i] = [x_i, y_i, time_i]` indicates that person `x_i` and person `yi`
have a meeting at `timei`. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same
time. Finally, you are given an integer `firstPerson`.

Person `0` has a **secret** and initially shares the secret with a person
`firstPerson` at time `0`. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes
place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a
person `x_i` has the secret at `time_i`, then they will share the secret with
person `y_i`, and vice versa.

The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret
and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.

Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have
taken place. You may return the answer in any order.

## Solution

If a meeting happened with a person that has a secret, the two participant
should be in the same *union*. We could achieve this fast by using Disjoint Set
data structure. See
[here](/posts/leetcode-2316/#disjoint-set) for some
details about disjoint set.

Since the time of the meeting happening is important, we will have to sort all
the meetings before processing. Moreover, after each day of meetings, we have to
check if the union are the union that shared the secret (by checking if
`find_set(0)` and `find_set(i)` are the same as node 0 always possess the
secret). If the union of nodes does not have the secret, we have to "reset" the
union. If reset operations are not done, the union that does not have the secret
might be wrongly joined with the union that has the secret in the meetings, and
also pulled a large set of nodes that have not meet with any node that possess
the secret.

## Implementation

```cpp
class DisjointSet {
public:
    DisjointSet(int n): parent(n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = i;
    }

    void union_set(int a, int b) {
        a = find_set(a);
        b = find_set(b);
        if (a != b) parent[b] = a;
    }

    int find_set(int v) {
        if (v == parent[v]) return v;
        return parent[v] = find_set(parent[v]);
    }

    bool is_union(int a, int b) {
        a = find_set(a);
        b = find_set(b);
        return a == b;
    }

    // "reset" the union
    void reset(int v) {
        parent[v] = v;
    }

private:
    vector<int> parent;
};

class Solution {
public:

    vector<int> findAllPeople(int n, vector<vector<int>>& meetings, int firstPerson) {
        vector<int> output;
        DisjointSet dset(n);

        // sort meetings by date
        sort(meetings.begin(), meetings.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) -> bool {
                return a[2] < b[2];
            });

        dset.union_set(0, firstPerson);

        for (int i = 0; i < meetings.size();) {
            vector<int> meeted;
            int cur_date = meetings[i][2];
            for (; i < meetings.size() && meetings[i][2] == cur_date; i++) {
                dset.union_set(meetings[i][0], meetings[i][1]);
                meeted.push_back(meetings[i][0]);
                meeted.push_back(meetings[i][1]);
            }

            for (auto j: meeted) {
                if (!dset.is_union(0, j)) dset.reset(j);
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (dset.is_union(0, i)) output.push_back(i);
        }

        return output;
    }
};
```
