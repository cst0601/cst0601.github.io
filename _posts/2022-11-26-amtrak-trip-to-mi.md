Last year, I went to Michigan to visite a friend during holiday season. But why
not spending the time with my family? Well, plane ticket back to my hometown
costs too much. And for the same reason, I choose to take a train to visit my
friend.

Ah, the Amtrak, so infamous that I heard about it before I came to the US. But
still, I like going on a trip with trains and this is the first time that I take
a train that last more than a day. However, as I am traveling alone and I
do not have the money for a roomette or any kind of sleeper, I was stucked with
coach class. How nice, two days to spend on a chairðŸ˜„. However, this even I am
traveling in coach class, the ticket price still isn't cheap, probably because
it is holiday season. The total for a round trip from Riverside to Ann Arbor was
$506 via Southwest chief and Wolverine line.

According to the schedule, my train departs at 19:13 from Riverside and of
course it delayed. Well, I am not compalining about the delay since the track
around this area is probably owned by Union Pacific. Therefore, Amtrak would
need to wait for Union Pacific's freight trains to pass. What I am having
problem with, is there were no information about the delay, no signs about which
platform should I be wating for the train, no nothing. Thus, I was waiting in
dim light, praying that the platform I was on is the right one. Though
eventually I found someone to ask which platform will the train arrive, it
still was not a great experience. Compared to trains that I have taken before,
Taiwan and Japan railways, there always exist a clear sign of which platform
this is, what kind of train will arrive and probably a display showing when
the train will come.

When the train finally arrived, I was greeted by the train's crew, who checked
my ticked and assign a seat for me. To my surprise, seating is not
predetermined. It seemed like they sorted the passengers by their destinations
and order them when boarding. I wonder why it could not be decided
automatically when ordering the ticket. I suspect this has something to do
with their old ticketing system.

## 48 Hours of Train

Amtrak superliner. The train is large, double decker with one diesel power car
at the front, not what I am used to (most of the newer trains in Taiwan and most
of the trains in Japan have distributed power). The sleeper cars are in the
front, followed by one dining car, then a lounge car. Finally, there is two
coach class car.

The coach class seat is large (for my standard) and quite comfortable, it will
be horrible if it is not nice as I am going to spent 40 hours with it. Power plug
works normally (great). However, it is only available on the window side.
So as my seat is on the aisle side, I have no access to it, at least not in a
convenient way. But the good news is, there is a sightseer lounge car and there
are plenty power plugs.

Sightseer car is great, not many people stayed there at night so there are many
seats and spaces. I would say, even if the seat is not as comfortable as in the
coach class car, but without the people, it is even better than staying in the
back. With such a nice environment, I stayed here with my notebook until very
late. I left only my duffle bag, filled with clothes, back in the coach class
car and carried all the valuable things with me in my backpack as I am not
interested in getting stolen.

The network is ... not good. There was no wifi or any kind of network service
on the train. So you could only depend on your celluar. Whats worse, as the
train gradually travels towards nowhere, or the Rocky mountains, I could not
get good connection. It had been some time since the last time I was cut out
from any Internet connection. The good thing is I have my kindle with me.

### Sights of the Rocky Mountains

I woked up at dawn, just when the sun start rising. The orange light of the sun
shines at the large red dirt plain convered with some snow. It is a beautiful
sight that I have never seen before.

Then there are some places that looks just like movies set in the wild west.

It really feels strange for me to see places like this, where there is just
nothing. I spent most of my life in a island country, people could travel from
the highest mountains to the ocean in a few hours. And everywhere is crowded
with people. Seeing place like this makes me feels tiny and insignificant,
probably a bit lonely.

### Eating on Amtrak

I have a feeling that eating on train would cost me quite some money, therefore
I packed myself some rice balls with salmon, trying to depend less on whatever
they sell on train. And gosh it did cost me a lot. As I have mentioned before,
there is a dining car, however, they are for those in sleepers. If people in
coach class wanted to try out their food, it think you could also make a
reservation (and pay extra money).

Rice balls that I packed did not last long. I remember it disappeared before
lunch. Without an option, I ordered some food a the first floor of the lounge
car. It cost about as much as a meal in a fastfood restaurant, but the content
was abysmal. Here is a picture of it:

Yes. It is some microwaved stuff. The tea also tasts abysmal.  I missed those
excellent train bento you could find in Taiwan or Japan railways.

## Chicago Union Station

After many many hours on the train, I finally arrived at Chicago Union Station.
From here I made a transfer to wolverine line to Ann Arbor. The station is what
people would expect from an old style European / American central station.
The lobby is large and clean. In contrast, the waiting area for the train is
small and crowded. They would not allow people to be on the platform before
they started boarding passengers.

Before arrived at Chicago, I had a chat with a lady who sits beside me. I talked
about that there are high speed railways in Europe, Japan, Taiwan and America
probably should also have one. Even if high speed rail is not profitable, there
should be a effort to electrify the existing railroads to provide better
services. However the lady replied that it would not be possible as it would
cost too much as an infastructure, America is simply too big for these kind of
projects.

Although I knew that there are many problems that hinder any railway related
projects, such as many part of the network is owned by different private
companies, city plannings are mostly car centric etc. But I would not consider
cost to be a mojor factor, as Americans could spend billions of dollars on
highways and more to maintain them. Whatsmore, they are spending it without any
doubt. By contrast, California highspeed railway project has become a focus of
media for its budget. I would argue that blaming on costs could only serve as
an excuse for not liking to make a difference. There was a time that railroads
are the backbone of the states, with all the benefits that it could bring. But
after private cars and planes started to dominate transportation, trains began
to fell out of American's favor, even though trains are by no means, inferior
to cars and jets. Take Taiwan as an example, though the magnitute is vastly
different, there was a time that highway and regional airlines formed how people
would travel to different places. But after high speed railway was built, it
obliterated regional airline companies for its convenience and speed, even
though the whole project cost 16 billion dollars. No one complained about it
afterwards.

### Wolverine

Back to Amtrak. I am probably going write some more about trains, but not now.
Wolverine is far better than Southwest chief in terms of speed. The seat is also
large and comfortable. If Amtrak started to consider electrifying any route,
I would say this is the perfect line for that. (referncing a great video on
this topic: [The 3 Amtrak Routes that can be Electrified Tomorrow](https://youtu
.be/-yHqXMIvQXw)) The trip from Chicago to Ann Arbor took me around 5 hours. I
got better internet connection along the way, far better than Southwest Chief.

After 48 hours from I stepped inside the train, I finally arrived at Ann Arbor.
It was almost midnight when I walked out of the station. Luckly, it was only a
couple hundred meters to my friend's place. To sum up this trip, though Amtrak
is not very great, it is still quite an experience. Next time if I am traveling
to east coast, I'm probably taking California Zephyr. :)
