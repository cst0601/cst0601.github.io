## Description

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in `s`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.

## Solution

This is very similar to the problem [Longest Common
Subsequence](/posts/leetcode-1143/) if you look very closely.

Basically we are searching for the longest common subseqnence of string `s` and
the reversed string `s`.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
        size_t n = s.size() + 1;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n));

        for (size_t i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (size_t j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (s[i-1] == s[s.size()-j])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }

        return dp.back().back();
    }
};
```

```rs
impl Solution {
    pub fn longest_palindrome_subseq(s: String) -> i32 {
        let n = s.len()+1;
        let mut dp: Vec<Vec<i32>> = vec![vec![0; n]; n];

        for (i, c1) in s.chars().enumerate() {
            for (j, c2) in s.chars().rev().enumerate() {
                dp[i+1][j+1] = if (c1 == c2) {
                    dp[i][j] + 1
                } else {
                    std::cmp::max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
                }
            }
        }

        dp[n-1][n-1]
    }
}
```
