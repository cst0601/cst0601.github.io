## Problem

Given two integer arrays `inorder` and `postorder` where `inorder` is the
inorder traversal of a binary tree and `postorder` is the postorder traversal of
the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

## Solution

* We can see that the last element of the `postorder` sequence is the root of
  the tree.
* The **location** of this element in `inorder` sequence seperates **left
  subtree** and the **right subtree**.
* For `postorder` sequence, we could determin the elements for left and right
  subtree from the inorder sequence. The relative location (left/right subtree)
  of element in sequence in preserved even in postorder traverse. (In post
  order, we visited the nodes in the order LRV)
* Now we could see that the divided sequence is the same subproblem. Therefore,
  by doing the above recursively, we could rebuild the whole tree.

## Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* runner(vector<int>& inorder, vector<int>& postorder,
                     int in_left, int in_right, int post_left, int post_right) {
        if (in_left > in_right || post_left > post_right) return nullptr;

        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(postorder[post_right]);
        int mid = in_left;
        while (inorder[mid] != postorder[post_right]) mid++;

        int post_offset = mid-in_left;

        root->left = runner(inorder, postorder, in_left, mid-1, post_left, post_left+post_offset-1);
        root->right = runner(inorder, postorder, mid+1, in_right, post_left+post_offset, post_right-1);

        return root;
    }

    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& inorder, vector<int>& postorder) {
        if (inorder.empty()) return nullptr;

        int n = inorder.size();

        return runner(inorder, postorder, 0, n-1, 0, n-1);
    }
};
```
