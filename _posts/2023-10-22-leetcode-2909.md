## Description

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` of integers.

A triplet of indices `(i, j, k)` is a **mountain** if:
* `i < j < k`
* `nums[i] < nums[j]` and `nums[k] < nums[j]`

Return the *minimum possible sum* of a mountain triplet of `nums`. *If no such
triplet exists*, return `-1`.

## Solution

Saw this problem on Leetcode's Weekly Contest 368. The contest also includes
Leetcode 2908, which is basically the same problem but with smaller test data
that we could brute force it.

Back to solving the problem.

We are finding the **minimum triplets**, of index `(i, j, k)` where `i < j < k`.
`nums[i]` and `nums[k]` will apparently be the smallest number before / after
index `j`. However, we want to avoid searching the smallest numbers before `j`
and smallest numbers after `j` by iterating every index `j`.

To solve this, we could build two arrays to store the minimum number *up to this
point*, one iterates forward and another backwards.

Then we iterate through the array `nums` once more to get the minimum sum. The
time complexity for this algorithm will be $O(n)$.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        size_t n = nums.size();
        int output = numeric_limits<int>::max();
        vector<int> leftMin(n, numeric_limits<int>::max());
        vector<int> rightMin(n, numeric_limits<int>::max());
        leftMin[0] = nums[0];
        rightMin[n-1] = nums[n-1];

        for (size_t i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            leftMin[i] = min(leftMin[i-1], nums[i]);
            rightMin[n-i-1] = min(rightMin[n-i], nums[n-i-1]);
        }

        for (size_t i = 1; i < n-1; i++) {
            if (leftMin[i-1] < nums[i] && rightMin[i+1] < nums[i])
                output = min(output, leftMin[i-1] + rightMin[i+1] + nums[i]);
        }

        return (output == numeric_limits<int>::max()? -1: output);
    }
};
```

### Things didn't go well...

For some reason, I did not solve this problem during contest but managed to do
it in 5 minutes the day after. And out of pride or something about holding a
masters degree in computer science, I refused to solve it by brute force to at
least get the points from the first problem(the same question with smaller size
test data). `feels_bad_man.png`
